### Build

Found in slite-core [install.bat](slite-core%2Flib%2Finstall.bat) execution, or in the console

```shell
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=cn.note.swing -DartifactId=note-swing-core -Dversion=1.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=note-swing-core-1.0.2.jar
```

> ps:swing-core-1.0.2.jar It's a fast-food-style jar with some not-so-elegant swing components built-in. Mainly less elegant in custom UI styling and internationalization.

### Packaged
